Ok, alread a list of known bugs is being made.

   ++ [Jan-27-1998] There is a galaxy width problem--you can go past
                    the right and bottom boundaries.  I'll fix this
                    as soon as possible.
    - [Jan-29-1998] Fixed -- Brandon
   ++ [Jan-27-1998] Some people have reported that they cannot see, torps.
                    Please report the problem if it happens to you.

And to answer a few other questions:

      No, this is not the standard paradise source--a few years ago I
      branched the paradise source to create paradise 3.  Recently I blew
      the dust off that branch and merged it with the latest paradise 2
      source from Eric Dorman (2.4p10A).  In addition to that I cleaned
      up a lot of crap--it now compiles under strict ANSI compliance, and
      its much easier to install and manage.  Eventually I will release
      the source.

designed to keep all combat necessary keys on the left hand (so you dont
have to move your right hand away from the mouse)
