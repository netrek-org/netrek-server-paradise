2.4 patch 1b: (Brandon Gillespie / Rob Forsman)

   * Observer bug fix
   * even better setup script.  Note: it is now in the NETREKDIR, not
     NETREKDIR/src (so you can remove NETREKDIR/src/setup).
   * Galaxy Generator #6.  This isn't really more than Heath's Galaxy
     Generator #3 with a few tweaks on the settings, but I made it
     another generator rather than a define in config.h so you can use
     both generators.
   * Made the robot actually say something in binary (before he didn't)
   * Fixed the rank exemption for GODLIKE people (top to ranks of royalty)
     on ships.  Before it was backwards (i.e. Wesleys were exempt).
   * Exempted GODLIKE people from cluechecker #2
   * Added the RSA exemption file (Rob's)
   * fixed the WE ARE CLOSED message (wasn't displaying because line was
     too long).

2.4 patch 2: (Brandon Gillespie)

   * Adjusted default values per PLC decision
   * fixed some problems in the setup script
   * fixed a minor bug with announcing the end of a game.

2.4 patch 3: (Bob Glamm)

   * Despite this patch having my name on it, I contributed no actual
       code to this patch.  Rather, it is a compilation of bug fixes
       that people such as Sujal, Rob, and Joe contributed to the 
       mailing list but were too small to be considered 2.4p3
       individually.  Maybe they should have been 2.4p2.1, 2.2, etc??

2.4 patch 4: (Mike McGrath)

   * Added support for terrain features.
   * Implemented asteroids using the new terrain stuff.

2.4 patch 5: (Bob Glamm)

   * I actually did the coding for this one.
   * Socket code for Mike's terrains (nebula/asteroids)

2.4 patch 6: (Mike McGrath)
 
   * Asteroids are completely finished -- fields have different
     densities, thicknesses, distances from their parent star, etc.
   * Asteroids affect ships, in addition to weapons.
   * New PLC ship values turned default.

2.4 patch 7: (Bob Glamm)

   * Added FEATURE_PACKETS so the server wouldn't hose the client if the
     client couldn't understand terrain.  Note that these are probably not the
     same thing as Bronco feature packets.  Define as FEATURE in config.h
     (on by default).

2.4 patch 8: (Gary Parnes, Ken Germann)

   * Added higher wtemp for butt torpers (Gary Parnes)
   * Added ship-variable det distances (Ken Germann)

2.4 patch 9: (Mike McGrath)

   * Added basic nebula code
   * New orbital code, so planets don't end up same dist from stars, and so
     orbiting planets don't overlap.
   * New detdist (1750) made default,
     Variable det dist stuff used for CVs, and UTs, to make them tougher.
   * New low-fuel based explosion values made default.
   * Self-hurting torps made optional.
