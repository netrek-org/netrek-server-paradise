	------ Netrek II: Paradise - Server ChangeLog ------


2000-04-26	Jeffrey Watts <watts@users.sourceforge.net>

	Cleaned up the snake code.  Snakes now come in as IND by default
	(before it was random).  The usage statement has been enhanced
	and now gets issued on any command errors.  I also added 'snake'
	to the set of available god commands.

	Files: snake/snake.c, snake/snakemove.c, ntserv/message.c,
	include/defs.h

	Added the first pass of the new "newbie" robot, RobotServ.  This
	robot is the modified base practice robot ("Smack") from Bronco.
	Thanks to Jeffrey Nowakowski for the mods that allow it to be
	used for our purposes.

	Files: robot/robot_newbie.c, robot/robot_newbie.h

	Minor fix to 'wm' to make the '-k' option behave like the usage
	statement says it should behave.  Removed pointless "-h" line in
	the usage statement.

	Files: tools/tool-wm.c

2000-04-18	Jeffrey Watts <watts@users.sourceforge.net>

	Tweaked galaxygen-9.c to diminish variance in the placement of
	race and independent systems.  Added this ChangeLog.
